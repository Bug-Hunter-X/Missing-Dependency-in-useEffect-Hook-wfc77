# Missing Dependency in useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: missing dependencies in the dependency array.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as infinite loops or incorrect state updates.

## Bug Description
The `useEffect` hook in `bug.js` is missing a dependency.  This means that the effect will not re-run when the value of the missing dependency changes, leading to stale closures and potential bugs.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code.  The missing dependency has been added to the dependency array, ensuring that the effect re-runs whenever the relevant values change.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the console logs to see the differences in behavior between the buggy and corrected versions of the code.
